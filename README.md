# RetroRoller

Based on ArchLinux, RetroRoller's primary focus is on performance to deliver the
best gaming experience. It is an open platform that anyone can and is encouraged
to contribute to.

If you have limited Linux knowledge or are expecting a no-fuss gaming experience
then you may consider using another image more geared towards non-technical
users such as EmuELEC or TheRA.

NOTE: It's highly recommended that you can and are comfortable with ssh'ing in
or using a USB keyboard in case you get stuck using this OS.

See the [Installation page](https://github.com/valadaa48/retroroller/wiki/Installation) on our [Wiki](https://github.com/valadaa48/retroroller/wiki) to get started using RetroRoller.

### What's been upstreamed so far

So far we've managed to upstream the mali and rga userspace drivers into the
official ArchLinux ARM repos. The ArchLinux ARM maintainer is open to merge 
my kernel package after he's acquired an OGA himself for testing.
